Remidners:
1. Drawing isn't meant for planning, don't waste your time on it.
2. Approach for balancing. Build difficulty progression -> then build and balance player's progression and tools

Next steps:

////////////// Milestones //////////////
1. Finish the raw version of generation
2. Implement all assets
3. Add effects and animations
4. Implement menus and pause
5. Finish game loop, victory/defeat states
7. Rework the tutorial

////////////// Check
> fix attacker counters
> make your crew immune to cannons


/////// Polishing round 1
> display ui
    > crew count
    > ship hp
    > resources
> fix: cancel drop points if too far
> deactivate current button when it is clicked again

/////// Polishing later
> add crawlps attack animation
> cannon ball shoot burst
> cannon ball smoke trace
> entity throw state
> crew throwing out of ship
> crew pulling back to ship
> turn off select box in menu
> button icons
> better units hp
> heal vfx
> protectin vfx


//// Check
> cost for all actions

//// Gameplay core top priority
> ui: ship's health bar
> ui: crew count
> fairies
> train archers in settlements
> victory state
> loose state
> bind ui to nums

//// Second priority
> spread mining reources
> boarded crew count
> limit boarding speed
> ui actions cooldown
> ui actions visualize active state

> boss fight
    > focus camera on the boss after spawning
    > finish boss music transition

//// Fixes
> fix island not finding his resources (instance_exists)
> fix watch multiple tower bug
> fix map button not becoming greya
> fix moon movement delay (html?)


/////// Feedback
> show crew total counts
> better communicate buying
> tell them to switch to Chrome
> enemies constantly threaten, give players pauses from fighting


////////// Polishing, improvments and ideas //////////
> import the newest audio assets
> fix: change Esc button to Q?
> balance: make ship arrows and cannon balls consumables
> fix instance manager: leave areas with player presence (buildings/crew) active
> drop crew by launching from the ship "wheee"
> protection aura tower?
> fix ui state not resetting when Esc or click on other ui (cannon)
> fix audio: play ui click only on successful action
> controls rebind
> more live UI: animations, scaling, shaking, etc.
> ai
    > make them spread
> life quality
    > let rebind mouse actions
    > commands ui: cursor sprites
> buildings
    > watch tower - expand your view in the area

> temporary rich islands
> settlements actively mining resources
> if not moving far for a long time, spawn enemies nearby

> wrath usage: kill underwater stuff

> idea: no crew mod, cannon cost = 0

> scrolls
    > minions boost
    > teleport
    > witches' punishment (long range beam)
> turn archers back to buddies
> select box trigger by coords
> set timer on some sfx


////// Lessons learned
> GM: don't use layer_destroy() and instance_activate/deactivate()
> I love optimization!!! (but not the graphics one)
> At some html build was broken by pure presence of a particle system IN THE PROJECT, not in the game
  Removing it fixed the problem.
