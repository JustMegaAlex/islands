Remidners:
1. Drawing isn't meant for planning, don't waste your time on it.
2. Approach for balancing. Build difficulty progression -> then build and balance player's progression and tools

Next steps:

////////////// Milestones //////////////
1. Finish the raw version of generation
2. Implement all assets
3. Add effects and animations
4. Implement menus and pause
5. Finish game loop, victory/defeat states
7. Rework the tutorial

////////////// Check
> fix attacker counters
> make your crew immune to cannons


/////// Polishing round 1
> display ui
    > crew count
    > ship hp
    > resources
> fix: cancel drop points if too far
> deactivate current button when it is clicked again

/////// Polishing later
> add crawlps attack animation
> cannon ball shoot burst
> cannon ball smoke trace
> entity throw state
> crew throwing out of ship
> crew pulling back to ship
> turn off select box in menu
> button icons
> better units hp
> heal vfx
> protectin vfx


//// Check
> cost for all actions

//// Gameplay core top priority
> ui: crew count
> fairies
> train archers in settlements
> victory state
> loose state
> bind ui to nums
> boss fight
    > focus camera on the boss after spawning
    > finish boss music transition
> fay scroll info text
> fix disappearing folks
> add pause menu hint


//// Second priority
> limit boarding speed
> ui actions cooldown
> ui actions visualize active state


> spread mining reources

//// Fixes
> fix island not finding its resources (instance_exists)
> fix building ui not becoming greyed out when not available
> fix watch multiple tower bug
> fix map button not becoming greya
> fix moon movement delay (html?)
> fix archers focusing on unreachable targets
> fix select box delay


/////// Feedback
> enemies constantly threaten, give players pauses from fighting
> players are lost and don't know what to do at the start


////////// Polishing, improvments and ideas //////////
> polish: falling trees
> fix instance manager: leave areas with player presence (buildings/crew) active
> drop crew by launching from the ship "wheee"
> protection aura tower?
> fix audio: play ui click only on successful action
> controls rebind
> more live UI: animations, scaling, shaking, etc.
> ai
    > make them spread
> life quality
    > let rebind mouse actions
    > commands ui: cursor sprites
> buildings
    > watch tower - expand your view in the area

> temporary rich islands
> settlements actively mining resources
> if not moving far for a long time, spawn enemies nearby


> idea: make ship arrows and cannon balls consumables
> idea: wrath usage: kill underwater stuff
> idea: no crew mod, cannon cost = 0
> idea: a screaming enemy that attracts all enemies around
> idea: harpoon ability: attack underwater creatures and pull resources
> idea: gen: 
    - static generation: cells generate more resources and enemies over time
    - dynamic enemies spawn as is
    - option to choose "chill" mode without dynamic enemies
> idea: turn archers back to buddies
> idea: get experience for killing? upgrade skills?
> idea: get enfir for killing

> scrolls
    > minions boost
    > teleport
    > witches' punishment (long range beam)
> select box trigger by coords
> set timer on some sfx


////// Ideas for other incarnations
> starcraft-like roguelike strategy


////// Lessons learned
> GM: in html don't use layer_destroy() and instance_activate/deactivate()
> I love optimization!!! (but not the graphics one)
> At some html build was broken by pure presence of a particle system IN THE PROJECT, not in the game
  Removing it fixed the problem.
